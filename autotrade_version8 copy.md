### Data 3: Previous Decisions
- **Purpose**: This section details the insights gleaned from the most recent trading decisions undertaken by the system. It serves to provide a historical backdrop that is instrumental in refining and honing future trading strategies. Incorporate a structured evaluation of past decisions against OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close and Volume) data to systematically assess their effectiveness.
- **Contents**: 
    - Each record within `last_decisions` chronicles a distinct trading decision, encapsulating the decision's timing (`timestamp`), the action executed (`decision`), the proportion of the portfolio it impacted (`percentage`), the reasoning underpinning the decision (`reason`), and the portfolio's condition at the decision's moment (`balance`, `krw_balance`, `avg_buy_price`).
        - `timestamp`: Marks the exact moment the decision was recorded, expressed in milliseconds since the Unix epoch, to furnish a chronological context.
        - `decision`: Clarifies the action taken—`buy`, `sell`, or `hold`—thus indicating the trading move made based on the analysis.
        - `percentage`: Denotes the fraction of the portfolio allocated for the decision, mirroring the level of investment in the trading action.
        - `reason`: Details the analytical foundation or market indicators that incited the trading decision, shedding light on the decision-making process.
        - `balance`: Reveals the quantity of cryptocurrency within the portfolio at the decision's time, demonstrating the portfolio's market exposure.
        - `krw_balance`: Indicates the amount of Korean Won available for trading at the time of the decision, signaling liquidity.
        - `avg_buy_price`: Provides the average acquisition cost of the cryptocurrency holdings, serving as a metric for evaluating the past decisions' performance and the prospective future profitability.

### Data 4: Fear and Greed Index
- **Purpose**: The Fear and Greed Index serves as a quantified measure of the crypto market's sentiment, ranging from "Extreme Fear" to "Extreme Greed." This index is pivotal for understanding the general mood among investors and can be instrumental in decision-making processes for cryptocurrency trading. Specifically, it helps in gauging whether market participants are too bearish or bullish, which in turn can indicate potential market movements or reversals. Incorporating this data aids in balancing trading strategies with the prevailing market sentiment, optimizing for profit margins while minimizing risks.
- **Contents**:
  - The dataset comprises 30 days' worth of Fear and Greed Index data, each entry containing:
    - `value`: The index value, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), reflecting the current market sentiment.
    - `value_classification`: A textual classification of the index value, such as "Fear," "Greed," "Extreme Fear," or "Extreme Greed."
    - `timestamp`: The Unix timestamp representing the date and time when the index value was recorded.
    - `time_until_update`: (Optional) The remaining time in seconds until the next index update, available only for the most recent entry.
  - This data allows for a nuanced understanding of market sentiment trends over the past month, providing insights into investor behavior and potential market directions.




### Clarification on Ask and Bid Prices
- **Ask Price**: The minimum price a seller accepts. Use this for buy decisions to determine the cost of acquiring cryptocurrency.
- **Bid Price**: The maximum price a buyer offers. Relevant for sell decisions, it reflects the potential selling return.    

### Instruction Workflow
#### Pre-Decision Analysis:

1. **Review Current Investment State and Previous Decisions**: Start by examining the most recent investment state and the history of decisions to understand the current portfolio position and past actions. review the outcomes of past decisions to understand their effectiveness. This review should consider not just the financial results but also the accuracy of your market analysis and predictions.




2. **Analyze Market and Orderbook**: Assess market trends and liquidity. Consider how the orderbook's ask and bid sizes might affect market movement.

3. **Analyze Fear and Greed Index**: Evaluate the 30 days of Fear and Greed Index data to identify trends in market sentiment. Look for patterns of sustained fear or greed, as these may signal overextended market conditions ripe for reversal. Consider how these trends align with technical indicators and market analysis to form a comprehensive view of the current trading environment.

4. **Refine Strategies**: Use the insights gained from reviewing outcomes to refine your trading strategies. This could involve adjusting your technical analysis approach, or tweaking your risk management rules.


#### Decision Making:
5. **Synthesize Analysis**: Combine insights from market analysis, and the current investment state to form a coherent view of the market. Look for convergence between technical indicators to identify clear trading signals.

6. **Apply Risk Management Principles**: Before finalizing any decision, reassess the potential risks involved. Ensure that any proposed action aligns with your risk management strategy, considering the current portfolio balance, the investment state, and market volatility.

7. **Incorporate Market Sentiment Analysis**: Factor in the insights gained from the Fear and Greed Index analysis alongside technical analysis. Assess whether current market sentiment supports or contradicts your potential trading actions. Use this sentiment analysis to adjust the proposed action and investment proportion, ensuring that decisions are well-rounded and account for the psychological state of the market.

8. **Determine Action and Percentage**: Decide on the most appropriate action (buy, sell, hold) based on the synthesized analysis. Specify the percentage of the portfolio to be allocated to this action, keeping in mind to balance risk and opportunity. Your response must be JSON format.

### Adjusting for ROI
- **Calculate Expected ROI**: Before finalizing any trade decision, calculate the expected ROI using the formula `(Expected Return - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost`. Use market analysis and historical performance as a basis for your expectations.
- **Determine Investment Amount**: Adjust the investment amount based on the expected ROI and your risk management strategy. For higher expected ROIs, consider increasing the investment amount, but always keep within the bounds of your risk tolerance and portfolio balance strategy.
- **Example**: If the expected ROI on a trade is 10% and aligns with your risk tolerance, you might allocate a higher percentage of your portfolio compared to a trade with a lower expected ROI. This decision should factor in your overall investment strategy and market conditions.

### Considerations
- **Factor in Transaction Fees**: Upbit charges a transaction fee of 0.05%. Adjust your calculations to account for these fees to ensure your profit calculations are accurate.
- **Account for Market Slippage**: Especially relevant when large orders are placed. Analyze the orderbook to anticipate the impact of slippage on your transactions.
- Remember, the first principle is not to lose money. The second principle: never forget the first principle.
- Remember, successful investment strategies require balancing aggressive returns with careful risk assessment. Utilize a holistic view of market data, technical indicators, and current status to inform your strategies.
- Consider setting predefined criteria for what constitutes a profitable strategy and the conditions under which penalties apply to refine the incentives for the analysis engine.
- This task significantly impacts personal assets, requiring careful and strategic analysis.
- Take a deep breath and work on this step by step.
- Your response must be JSON format.

This strategic 'buy' stance aligns with a long-term investment perspective, anticipating future gains as market conditions evolve."})


(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "In a bullish trend reversal scenario, the tema_10 (Triple Exponential Moving Average with a period of 10) crossing above the close price suggests a potential shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. This crossover typically indicates that the shorter-term moving average is gaining strength relative to the closing price, potentially signaling the beginning of an upward trend. Therefore, the tema_10 should indeed be larger than the closing price to confirm the bullish trend reversal pattern."})


(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "In a bullish trend reversal scenario, the tema_20 (Triple Exponential Moving Average with a period of 20) crossing above the close price suggests a potential shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. This crossover typically indicates that the shorter-term moving average is gaining strength relative to the closing price, potentially signaling the beginning of an upward trend. Therefore, the tema_20 should indeed be larger than the closing price to confirm the bullish trend reversal pattern."})


(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The dema_10 has crossed above the dema_20, indicating a bullish trend reversal. This crossover is often considered a strong buy signal, suggesting a potential uptrend in the cryptocurrency pair. Historically, such crossovers have led to significant price rallies, supporting a bullish stance for further gains."})


(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The hma_10 has crossed above the hma_20, indicating a bullish trend reversal. This crossover often signals the beginning of an uptrend, suggesting a potential buying opportunity for the cryptocurrency pair. Historically, such crossovers have led to significant price rallies, supporting a bullish stance for further gains."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The wma_10 has crossed above the wma_20, suggesting a bullish trend reversal. This crossover often signals the beginning of an uptrend, indicating a potential buying opportunity for the cryptocurrency pair. Historically, such crossovers have preceded significant price rallies, supporting a bullish stance for further gains."})


(Response:  {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The fwma_10 has crossed above the fwma_20, indicating a bullish trend reversal. This crossover often signals the beginning of an uptrend, suggesting a potential buying opportunity for the cryptocurrency pair. Historical analysis indicates that such crossovers have preceded significant price rallies, supporting a bullish stance for further gains."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy","percentage": 20,  "reason": "The STOCHk_14_3_3 line has moved upwards from below 20, exiting the oversold territory, and the STOCHd_14_3_3 confirms this upward trend. This indicator suggests the market momentum is shifting, signaling a potential bullish reversal and a good buying point."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The RSI_14 has dropped below 30, suggesting the cryptocurrency pair is currently undervalued and likely to experience a price rebound. This oversold condition presents a favorable buying opportunity, anticipating a corrective rally."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The Bollinger Bands are contracting, indicating decreased market volatility. Historically, periods of low volatility are followed by significant market moves. Given the recent uptrend, this contraction suggests an imminent bullish breakout, making it a strategic time to buy."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "Following a minor retracement where the price touched the lower Bollinger Band, combined with an RSI_14 reading near 35, buying additional cryptocurrency leverages the dip as a strategic entry point, anticipating a rebound to recent highs."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "Despite a bullish trend indicated by the EMA_10 crossing above the SMA_10, a thin sell wall in the orderbook suggests low resistance ahead. Coupled with a strong buying pressure as seen in the total bid size exceeding the ask size, the market condition is ripe for a swift upward movement, making it an optimal buying opportunity."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The market shows a strong bullish momentum as the MACD is above the signal line and the RSI_14 indicates a strong buying pressure without being overbought. The orderbook reveals a deep bid support with significantly higher bid size compared to ask size near the current price, suggesting a robust support level. Considering the transaction fee of 0.05%, the depth of bid support minimizes the risk of slippage, presenting a favorable buying opportunity to capitalize on the expected upward trend."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "Technical analysis shows a tightening Bollinger Band with the price consolidating near the upper band, suggesting a potential breakout. The orderbook supports this with a decreasing ask size at slightly higher levels, indicating weak resistance ahead. Despite the 0.05% transaction fee and potential for minimal slippage, the expected breakout provides a strategic buying opportunity. The convergence of these indicators points towards an imminent price surge, making it an optimal time to buy before the breakout fully materializes."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The Chaikin Money Flow ("cmf") indicator has surged above 0, indicating strong buying pressure and significant capital inflow into the market. This suggests a bullish momentum and a potential upward trend reversal. Additionally, the cmf has remained consistently positive for the past few periods, indicating sustained buying interest. Combined with other bullish signals such as the MACD bullish crossover and the RSI_14 trending above 40, the current market conditions present a compelling buying opportunity. Considering the depth of bid support and the absence of significant sell pressure, purchasing cryptocurrency at the current price levels could yield favorable returns in the short to medium term."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "When the "SQZPRO_20_2.0_20_2_1.5_1" value is positive, it indicates that the Squeeze Pro indicator is positive, signifying a contraction in volatility between the Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels. This suggests an imminent sharp price movement, potentially influencing buy or sell decisions. Analyzing the order book, a decrease in the size of ask orders at slightly higher levels implies weak resistance. Despite a 0.05% transaction fee and potential for minimal slippage, an expected breakout presents a strategic buying opportunity. The convergence of these indicators suggests an imminent price surge, making it an optimal time to buy before the breakout fully materializes."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "When "SQZPRO_ON_WIDE" is indicated as 1, it signifies a squeeze occurring within a wide range of Keltner Channels, suggesting a significant change in volatility and typically indicating a moment of rapid price movement. Therefore, this may influence buy or sell decisions. Additional analysis of the order book may reveal insights such as decreasing ask size at higher levels, indicating weak resistance. Despite potential transaction fees and slippage, the expected breakout presents a strategic buying opportunity. The convergence of these indicators suggests an imminent price surge, making it an optimal time to buy before the breakout fully materializes."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "When "SQZPRO_ON_NORMAL" is indicated as 1, it signifies a squeeze occurring within a normal range of Keltner Channels, suggesting volatility is within typical levels and price movement may be expected. This could influence buy or sell decisions. Further analysis of market sentiment may reveal stable bid support and ask resistance, indicating potential price consolidation. Despite potential transaction fees and slippage, purchasing cryptocurrency at the current price levels could yield favorable returns in the short to medium term."})


(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "When "SQZPRO_ON_NARROW" is indicated as 1, it signifies a squeeze occurring within a narrow range of Keltner Channels, indicating significantly reduced volatility and typically suggesting a high potential for large price movements. This could influence buy or sell decisions. Further examination of order flow may reveal decreasing liquidity, indicating potential price breakouts. Despite potential transaction fees and slippage, purchasing cryptocurrency at the current price levels could lead to substantial gains in the short term."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "Considering that "FISHERT_9_1" value is above 0 and "FISHERTs_9_1" value is also above 0, it may be a good idea to consider buying. This indicates that the Fisher Transform value has crossed above its signal line, suggesting an increase in upward momentum. However, it's important to note that this doesn't guarantee a perfect buying opportunity, and further analysis along with confirmation from other indicators is recommended."})

(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "When the "ADX_14" value is 25 or higher, it is considered that a strong trend has formed. Additionally, when the DMP_14 value is higher than the DMN_14 value, indicating a positive directional movement, it confirms the direction of the trend. Therefore, a buy decision can be made in a market where a strong upward trend is forming."})


(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "When the "AMATe_SR_8_21_2" value is 1, it indicates an uptrend in the stock price. Therefore, it is considered a buy signal, suggesting it is advantageous to buy and hold stocks in the current market."})


(Response: {"decision": "buy", "percentage": 20, "reason": "Given the current bullish market indicators and a significant `krw_balance`, purchasing additional cryptocurrency could leverage the upward trend for increased returns. The current market price is below the `avg_buy_price`, presenting a favorable buying opportunity to average down the cost basis and enhance potential profits."})



Example: Recommendation to Hold 


(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "Although the MACD is above the Signal Line, indicating a buy signal, the MACD Histogram's decreasing volume suggests weakening momentum. It's advisable to hold until clearer bullish signals emerge."}) 


(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "The price is currently testing the Upper Bollinger Band while the RSI_14 is nearing overbought territory at a level just below 70. These conditions, although generally bullish, suggest a possible short-term pullback. Holding is advised to capitalize on potential buy opportunities at lower prices following the pullback, optimizing entry points for increased profitability."}) 


(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "Current market analysis reveals a converging triangle pattern on the hourly charts, suggesting an impending volatility breakout. With the MACD line flattening near the Signal Line and no clear direction from the RSI_14, which remains around the midpoint of 50, the market appears indecisive. Holding now is recommended to await a clearer signal post-breakout, ensuring entry or augmentation of positions is aligned with the new trend direction for maximized gains."}) 


(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "The market is currently in a consolidation phase, with the price oscillating within a tight range between the Upper and Lower Bollinger Bands. This indicates indecision in the market. Holding is advised until a clear breakout direction is established, which would signal a more definitive trading opportunity."}) 

(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "Volume analysis shows a divergence where price levels continue to rise, but trading volume is decreasing. This lack of volume support for the price increase suggests that the uptrend may not be sustainable in the short term. It's recommended to hold and monitor for increased volume to confirm the trend's strength before making further purchases."}) 


(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "The current price is nearing a historical resistance level, which has previously led to significant pullbacks. With the RSI_14 approaching overbought conditions and no significant volume increase, there's potential for a price correction. Holding is recommended to reassess after observing the market's reaction to this resistance zone."}) 


(Response: {"decision": "hold","percentage": 0, "reason": "The current market situation presents a classic case of indecision, with the price of cryptocurrency oscillating around the 20-day EMA, indicating a lack of clear directional momentum. Simultaneously, the RSI_14 hovers around the 50 mark, further suggesting equilibrium between buying and selling pressures. Given the absence of convincing bullish or bearish signals and the proximity of the price to crucial moving averages, holding is the most prudent strategy. This cautious approach allows for the preservation of capital while awaiting more definitive trends to emerge, either for a potential buying opportunity at support levels or selling at resistance."}) 

(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "While technical indicators suggest a bullish market, the orderbook shows a large sell wall just above the current price, indicating strong overhead resistance. Given this potential for slippage and the impact of transaction fees, holding is advised until a clearer path for upward movement is observed."}) 

(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "While the SMA_10 and EMA_10 indicate a bullish trend, the RSI_14 is nearing overbought territory. The orderbook shows a large ask wall just above the current price, suggesting significant resistance. These mixed signals, combined with the consideration of a 0.05% transaction fee and the risk of slippage when breaking through the sell wall, advise caution. Holding is recommended until the market provides a clearer direction, potentially after the sell wall is absorbed or the technical indicators align more definitively."}) 

(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "The current market setup shows an equilibrium state with the RSI_14 around 50 and a balanced orderbook depth, where ask and bid sizes are closely matched, indicating high liquidity but no clear direction. Given this market indecision and the transaction costs involved, holding becomes a prudent strategy. This allows for maintaining a position ready to capitalize on clearer signals for either buying or selling as they emerge, without incurring unnecessary fees or facing slippage in a stable market."}) 

(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "When SQZPRO_NO is indicated as 1, it suggests that no squeeze has occurred. This indicates that volatility is currently within typical levels and no specific price action is expected. Therefore, it may be prudent to hold cryptocurrency positions and wait for clearer market signals before making buying or selling decisions."})


(Response: {"decision": "hold", "percentage": 0, "reason": "The current market price is slightly above the avg_buy_price, indicating a modest profit. However, given the uncertain market direction and a balanced orderbook, holding is recommended to await clearer signals. This strategy maximizes potential gains while minimizing risk, considering the substantial balance."})

(Response: {  
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "After a comprehensive review of the current market conditions, historical data, and previous decision outcomes, the present analysis indicates a complex trading environment. Although the MACD remains above its Signal Line, suggesting a potential buy signal, a notable decrease in the MACD Histogram's volume highlights diminishing momentum. This observation suggests caution, as weakening momentum could precede a market consolidation or reversal. Concurrently, the RSI_14 and SMA_10 indicators do not present clear signals, indicating a market in balance rather than one trending strongly in either direction.  Considering these factors alongside a review of our portfolio's current state and in alignment with our risk management principles, the decision to hold reflects a strategic choice to preserve capital amidst market uncertainty. This cautious stance allows us to remain positioned for future opportunities while awaiting more definitive market signals."
})
(Response: {
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "Despite technical indicators suggesting a potential buy opportunity, the Fear and Greed Index shows sustained 'Extreme Greed' over the past week, with values consistently above 80. This condition suggests the market might be overextended, with a higher risk of correction. Considering the heightened risk indicated by market sentiment, a decision to hold and await clearer signals aligns with our risk management protocols."

    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "Despite technical indicators suggesting a potential buy opportunity, the Fear and Greed Index shows sustained 'Extreme Greed' over the past week, with values consistently above 80. This condition suggests the market might be overextended, with a higher risk of correction. Considering the heightened risk indicated by market sentiment, a decision to hold and await clearer signals aligns with our risk management protocols."
    "reason": "After thorough analysis, the consensus is to maintain a hold position due to several contributing factors. Firstly, the current market sentiment, as indicated by the Fear and Greed Index, remains in 'Extreme Greed' territory with a value of 79. Historically, sustained levels of 'Extreme Greed' often precede a market correction, advising caution in this highly speculative environment.\nSecondly, recent crypto news reflects significant uncertainties and instances of significant Bitcoin transactions by governmental bodies, along with a general trend of price volatility in response to fluctuations in interest rates. Such news contributes to a cautious outlook.\nFurthermore, the market analysis indicates a notable imbalance in the order book, with a significantly higher total ask size compared to the total bid size, suggesting a potential decrease in buying interest which could lead to downward price pressure.\nLastly, given the portfolio's current state, with no Bitcoin holdings and a posture of observing market trends, it is prudent to continue holding and wait for more definitive market signals before executing new trades. The strategy aligns with risk management protocols aiming to safeguard against potential market downturns in a speculative trading environment."

(Response: {
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "The decision to maintain our current Bitcoin holdings without further buying or selling actions stems from a holistic analysis, balancing technical indicators, market sentiment, recent crypto news, and our portfolio's state. Currently, the market presents a juxtaposition of signals: the RSI_14 hovers near 50, indicating a neutral market without clear overbought or oversold conditions. Simultaneously, the SMA_10 and EMA_10 are converging, suggesting a market in equilibrium but without sufficient momentum for a decisive trend. Furthermore, the Fear and Greed Index displays a 'Neutral' sentiment with a value of 50, reflecting the market's uncertainty and investor indecision. This period of neutrality follows a volatile phase of 'Extreme Greed', suggesting potential market recalibration and the need for caution. Adding to the complexity, recent crypto news has been mixed, with reports of both promising blockchain innovations and regulatory challenges, contributing to market ambiguity. Given these conditions, and in alignment with our rigorous risk management protocols, holding serves as the most prudent action. It allows us to safeguard our current portfolio balance, carefully monitoring the market for more definitive signals that align with our strategic investment criteria. This stance is not passive but a strategic pause, positioning us to act decisively once the market direction becomes clearer, ensuring that our investments are both thoughtful and aligned with our long-term profitability and risk management objectives."

Example: Recommendation to Sell
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The asset has experienced a sustained period of price increase, reaching a peak that aligns closely with historical resistance levels. Concurrently, the RSI_14 indicator has surged into overbought territory above 70, signaling that the asset might be overvalued at its current price. This overbought condition is further corroborated by a bearish divergence observed on the MACD, where the MACD line has begun to descend from its peak while prices remain high. Additionally, a significant increase in trading volume accompanies this price peak, suggesting a climax of buying activity which often precedes a market reversal. Given these factors - overbought RSI_14 levels, MACD bearish divergence, and high trading volume at resistance levels - a strategic sell is advised to capitalize on the current high prices before the anticipated market correction."})


(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "A bearish engulfing candlestick pattern has formed right at a known resistance level, suggesting a strong rejection of higher prices by the market. This pattern, especially when occurring after a prolonged uptrend and in conjunction with an RSI_14 reading nearing the 70 mark, indicates potential exhaustion among buyers. Selling now could preempt a reversal, securing profits from the preceding uptrend."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The asset's price has broken below the SMA_20 and EMA_20 on significant volume, signaling a loss of upward momentum and a potential trend reversal. This breakdown is particularly concerning as these moving averages have historically served as strong support levels. Exiting positions at this juncture could mitigate the risk of further declines as the market sentiment shifts."})


(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "The tema_10 is currently below the close price, suggesting a bearish trend continuation. Given the downward momentum indicated by this crossover and the potential for further price declines, selling is recommended to mitigate losses and potentially capitalize on short positions."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "A triple top formation has been identified, characterized by three unsuccessful attempts to break past a key resistance level, with each peak accompanied by decreasing volume. This pattern suggests waning buying pressure and a likely shift in market direction. Given the historical reliability of this formation as a precursor to bearish reversals, selling is advised to protect against anticipated downside risk."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "Both the Stochastic Oscillator and the RSI_14 have begun showing divergence from the price by making lower highs while the price itself registers higher highs. This divergence is a classic indication that the current uptrend is losing strength and might soon reverse. Liquidating positions now, while the market is near its peak, could be a prudent move to lock in gains."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "After a period of tight consolidation, the Bollinger Bands have started to expand dramatically, with the latest price action touching the lower band. This expansion, coupled with a confirmed close below the lower band, suggests an increase in volatility and a potential start of a downtrend. Given the asset's failure to maintain levels within the bands, selling could be advantageous to avoid potential losses in a volatile market."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "With the RSI_14 exceeding 70, indicating overbought conditions, and after achieving a 15 percent increase from the entry price, it's prudent to sell a portion of holdings to secure profits and reduce exposure to potential price corrections."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "Technical indicators point towards an overbought market with the RSI_14 above 70. The orderbook corroborates this by showing significant selling pressure with a large ask size at prices slightly above the current level. Taking into account transaction fees and potential slippage, selling now is recommended to secure profits before a possible downturn."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "Following a prolonged uptrend, technical indicators such as the RSI_14 entering the overbought zone (>70) and a bearish MACD crossover signal a potential reversal. The orderbook reflects increasing ask sizes at levels slightly above the current price, indicating growing selling pressure. Factoring in the 0.05% transaction fee and anticipating slippage due to the thickening sell wall, selling now is advantageous to lock in gains before the anticipated reversal intensifies, ensuring profits are maximized and protected from the downturn."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "A sell signal is generated when the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) falls below a specific threshold value (e.g., 0) and exhibits a downward trend compared to previous periods, in conjunction with other sell decisions."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "When the "SQZPRO_20_2.0_20_2_1.5_1" value is negative, it indicates an expansion in volatility between the Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels. This signifies a rapid price movement. Analyzing the order book, an increase in the size of ask orders during an uptrend implies strong selling pressure. Additionally, when combined with other sell signals such as a bearish crossover in the MACD and RSI_14 trending above 70, current market conditions support a sell decision.

Additionally, when combined with other sell signals such as a bearish crossover in the MACD and RSI_14 trending above 70, current market conditions support a sell decision. Considering the depth of buy and sell order support, selling cryptocurrency at the current price levels could yield favorable returns in the short term."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "When "SQZPRO_ON_NARROW" is indicated as 1, it suggests a squeeze occurring within a narrow range of Keltner Channels, indicating significantly reduced volatility and typically suggesting a high potential for large price movements. Analyzing order flow may reveal decreasing liquidity, indicating potential price breakouts. Additionally, when combined with other sell signals such as a bearish crossover in the MACD and RSI_14 trending above 70, current market conditions support a sell decision.

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "When the "ADX_14" value is below 20, it is considered a weak trend or no trend. Furthermore, when the DMP_14 value decreases below the DMN_14 value, indicating a weakening of the trend direction, it raises concerns about the weakening or reversal of the trend. Therefore, a sell decision can be made."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "Technical indicators reveal a nearing resistance level with the price approaching the upper Bollinger Band and the Stochastic Oscillator indicating overbought conditions. The orderbook data shows a substantial ask wall at this resistance level, likely hindering further price appreciation. With the transaction fee of 0.05% and potential slippage upon attempting to break through the significant resistance, a strategic sell is recommended. This decision allows for capitalizing on the current high before a possible price pullback, securing profits in a calculated manner."})

(Response: {"decision": "sell", "percentage": 20, "reason": "With the current market price significantly exceeding the `avg_buy_price` and indicating overbought conditions, selling a portion of the `balance` could secure profits and reduce exposure to potential corrections.

(Response: {
    "decision": "sell",
    "percentage": 20,
    "reason": "Upon detailed analysis of the asset's historical data and previous decision outcomes, it is evident that the asset is currently peaking near a historically significant resistance level. This observation is underscored by the RSI_14 indicator's ascent into overbought territory above 75, hinting at an overvaluation of the asset. Such overbought conditions are supported by a noticeable bearish divergence in the MACD, where despite the asset's price holding near its peak, the MACD line demonstrates a downward trajectory. This divergence aligns with a marked increase in trading volume, indicative of a potential buying climax which historically precedes market corrections. Reflecting on past predictions, similar conditions have often resulted in favorable sell outcomes, reinforcing the current decision to sell. Considering these factors - historical resistance alignment, overbought RSI_14, MACD bearish divergence, and peak trading volume - alongside a review of previous successful sell signals under comparable conditions, a strategic decision to sell 20% of the asset is recommended to leverage the anticipated market downturn and secure profits from the elevated price levels."

(Response: {
    "decision": "sell",
    "percentage": 20,
    "reason": "The choice to propose a sell action, representing a 20% allocation, stems from an intricate analysis of market trends, sentiment data, and portfolio status. Technical indicators and recent market behavior suggest a pivotal juncture in the trading landscape for the KRW-BTC pair. Specifically, the prevailing 'Extreme Greed' sentiments reflected in the Fear and Greed Index, consistently registering values above 75, coupled with recent price action nearing key resistance levels, forewarns of potential market saturation and an impending correction phase. This rationale is further substantiated by the occurrences in the crypto news landscape, where heightened interest and optimism around Bitcoin's halving event seems to drive speculative trading, rather than sustainable growth investments. The current market prices hover around historical highs, suggesting a ripe moment for realizing profits before a potential downturn, as indicated by overextended sentiment indices and the nearing of technical resistance points. This strategic sell aligns with risk management protocols by capitalizing on elevated market prices, ensuring the portfolio's resilience against possible value retractions, all the while navigating the volatile crypto market terrain judiciously."

(Response: {
    "decision": "sell",
    "percentage": 100,
    "reason": "An all-encompassing analysis, which involves recent news trends, technical indicators, the current market condition reflected in the Fear and Greed Index, and the portfolio's current stance, strongly points towards a strategic decision to sell 100% of the Bitcoin holdings. The analysis highlights that the market has been consistently in a state of 'Extreme Greed,' a sentiment that has historically preceded significant market corrections. Technical indicators such as the bearish MACD crossover, as well as the RSI_14 entering the overbought territory, further signal an impending downward correction. Coupled with the significant drop in Bitcoin's price below critical support levels (SMA_10 and EMA_10), and recent headlines showcasing widespread liquidations and price corrections across major cryptocurrencies, the current landscape is indicative of an elevated risk environment. This situation is further validated by our system's most recent decision to sell, informed by an integrated assessment of negative market trends. Given the current bid price (95889000 KRW) juxtaposed against the portfolio's average buy price (100274957.24713243 KRW), while acknowledging a potential loss, the decision to divest entirely seeks to protect the portfolio from further depreciation amidst escalating market volatility. This course of action aligns with a conservative risk management strategy, intending to preserve capital in anticipation of more favorable market conditions."
